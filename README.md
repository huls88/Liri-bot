Introducing Liri, the world's lamest personal assistant.

Why speak to a "smart" device, when you can whip open a terminal, navigate to the appropriate directory, make sure node is running and carefully type in the name of an application that you'll never remember?

How to use Liri:

From within the liri directory, type npm install to make sure you have all the necessary packages. (See below for required packages.)
Type node liri.
Make a selection from the menu.
Clean up the floor after your mind has been blown.

Required packages

Running npm install will take care of the necessary packages, but for reference's sake, here they are:

chalk (add swanky colors to terminal output)
first-run (check if it's the first time the process is run)
inquirer (create interactive prompts and menus)
node-spotify-api (Spotify API)
twitter (Twitter API)
request (make sexy HTTP calls)
